Book after standard Revelations (chap 1-22) in the apocalypse (Revelations Chapters 23-39) ðŸ‘‡

Chapter 23- And my dear worthy brother if thou covetous for to know though I know not how it is most perfect and most full right wiseness for to love God of all the heart for to cleave to him with all the will which is the most sovereign good forsooth for to love sovereign good is most sovereign bliss he that loves God is good if he is good therefore also he is blissful whom by how much a man loves more burningly by so much he shall be made better my dear brother with each days prayers and whole desire of heart though I be unworthy I study for to heartily pray him which is most sovereign good that he make the plenteous in the most blissful good but most dear brother understand thou that by counsel of the holy trinity and by the work of God's majesty thou are made of naught and of the first honor of making understand thou how much thou owe to thy maker while the everlasting maker gave anoon to thee in the making so much privilege of dignity that by so much thou should love him more fervently by how much thou understand thee for to be made more wonderful hear only this that with council of the holy trinity thou are made so excellently or worthy of thee maker but also that maker of naught of all things made thee of naught to his image and likeness which thing he granted to none other of creatures but to man alone and this is the image and likeness of unity and trinity of almighty God which thy soul has in itself the first for by the gift of God thy soul lives and understands thee second for it is formed to the image of his former or maker of naught the third though thou be called one man nevertheless thou has three dignities granted of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost that is to say understanding will and mind thee which same thing is signified in the gospel though it be by other words when it is said thou shall love the Lord thy God of all thine heart of all thy soul and of all thy strengths forsooth in these three our inner man that is the soul bears wonderfully in our kind the image of our maker of the which as of more passing dignities of the soul we been commanded for to love our maker that as much as he is understanding of us he be loved and those things that he commanded be they had and mind evermore it suffices not only to us for to understand God but his will be made our in love but neither this suffices but with mind and will not each man that says to me Lord Lord but he that does and serve work be put to and trust soothly to him thine head most dear brother grace of ghostly understanding be granted the which lighten thy soul and bring to everlasting life as I desire for with all the love of my heart I covet and heartily pray God that thou ever stretch thee to heavenly things till thou come to thee high crown of everlasting bliss and by no counsels of friends by no covetous of worldly desires suffer not the noble of thine mind which I know best in thee for to be changed from the love of Christ nothing kill thy love nile thou make dark thy goodness with wickedness of other men but everywhere as much as thou may appear worthy to be loved before God and all the people thee grace of God helping shall not fail to thee if will of holy teaching shall be to thee which the mind of the goodness has perceived often in the writings of God I beseech though thou be lewd be thou ready to the works of mercy in each work of God pitous to poor men and to sick comforter of the mourning having compassion to the miseries of all men large and alms deeds having mind of the gospel widow with two mites and on the prophet that says break thy bread to the hungry and beware saying before the discretion of alms so that it be solace of both the giver and the taker and so think not only of thine health but also of profit and prosperity of many choose to thee the best counselors dreading God and loving truth console not with flatteries for why flatteries often by flattering cheer deceive the souls of men hearing them and slain by the snares of everlasting death for of such the prophet says forsooth God scattered abroad the bones of them that please to men they been confounded for God has forsaken them and the apostle says if I pleased to men I were not the servant of Christ each man please his neighbor to edification and not to destruction for each friend may not be a counselor to thee says thee scripture says many friends been to thee but one counselor forsooth though dwelling changed have take me far from you in body but nevertheless no manner in charity for charity that may be left was never true therefore by most inward charity of friendships as much as we may be we joined together in the Lord Christ for he says ye been my friends if ye will do those things which I commanded to you and after he says to his disciples now I shall not see you servants but my friends and if we would privy the meeds of everlasting life busy we us with all strengths for to keep his commandments forsooth his commandments been grievous to men not willing but to men willing they been easy as he himself says for my yolk is soft and my burden easy and after he says on whom shall I rest but on the meek and restful and dreading my words forsooth the friendship of the world stands either in benefit either in diverse honors but the friendship of Jesus our savior is in loving him and our neighbors therefore how often ever we done in good deeds the commandments of Christ so often we been called the friends of Christ he called us ever to his friendship and the devil having envy seeks for to drench us in hell Jesus the savior loves us and the traitor the devil hates us therefore leave we not the redeemer neither serve we the robber he that restores us to freedom be more dear worthy to us than he that made us captive and under put us to bondage ever set thou God before the eyes of thine heart that company of friends neither multitude of thy money neither gathering of gold and of silver neither little stones shining of gems neither plenty of the fruit of vines neither thickness of corns neither sorrow neither stretching forth of meadows all this helps not in the day of death may bring any help to the soul going out of thy body but rather they mourn more that love them therefore the very friend our Lord Jesus Christ is to be loved which gives to us wellness now and everlasting wellness after for why he is said our redeemer for he bought us again from captivity of the devil and he is said savior in saving us from our sins and helper in helping us in opportunities in tribulation and he is said defender in defending us that we dwell unhurt among our enemies and he is said uptaker in taking us up into everlasting tabernacles therefore fulfill we the commands of charity and love we our so great a friend and keep we in us the nobility of his image think we ever how noble and full glorious is this emperor and our friend he seeks no other gift of us but spiritual gift be we aware as much as we may lest he find anything which offend his eyes and if perhaps as the condition of mans frailty is wonâ€™t the wicked spirit brings in us any spot of negligence anoon by acknowledging and penance of tears haste we us with all study for to wash it away lest we dwell long without embracing of our friend for he is more ready to receive us than he is to lose if we only tarry not from day to day for to turn again to him forsooth almighty God hates these two evils in all men that is to say negligence of turning again to him and despair of health beware these two neither these things be they only far from our thoughts and than he will be near to our souls I beseech that we glorying of earthly wellness trust we not therein but do we thankings to him the which Lord while he would that we were reasonable men prayed us by meekness and not by pride to serve him

Chapter 24- I pray what might be more glory to us or higher honor than for to be friends of that emperor which is above all emperors and by as much he is higher by all mighty hood in virtue by so much we owe for to be of more diligence in right wiseness and holiness and in meekness and keeping of his commandments soothly holiness stands in works of right wiseness and right wiseness is fulfilled on two manners that is take heed that we do not those things that been forbidden of him and also that we do those things that been commanded of him after the prophet that says turn thou away from evil and do good forsooth all the orders of holy books been written to our health and this sounds most to our ears and after and after rehearses what is to be showed of each man or what thing is to follow in which books thy worthiness waxing be it taught and in the best wise for by them our Lord God speaks and shows to us the desire of pitous will acknowledge we again and think we with what manner honor his message is to be received what if a message come to us from the king whether we would not anoon put other busyness behind and with a ready will and with all devotion take the letters and reading them we should enforce us to fulfill it lo the King of Kings and Lord of Lords yea and our redeemer vouched safe for to dress from heaven his letters by prophets and apostles not that he command to us any service that is needful to himself but that he make those things known to us that may profit to our health and our glory therefore if we delight to have anything in this world have we God with a ready soul which wields all things and made them of naught and in him we have what things ever we desire welsumly and holy but for no man has God only he that is had of God be we ourself made the possession of God and God would be made the possessor of us and what may be more welsum in the world than is to him to whom his emperor and redeemer is made rent and the Godhead itself denies to be made his heritage for of him all we take fruits in him and of him we live ever what thing I pray suffices to a man to whom the maker suffices not what seeks he more over to whom his redeemer owes to be all joy and all things alas thou subtly the same old beguiler deceives us and brings blindness before the reason of our soul that we may not deserve the joys of this world and the joys of everlasting kingdom for why it is good for to joy but who so joys if that he joy not there of where of he owes to joy it may not be good that he joys an earthly knight joys at the honors of this world that should soon perish at fair clothes and shapely the arms again about with buys he joy at the crown set on the head and such joy is not everlasting but to perishing also a robber joys when he has ravished things that he desired a drunken man joys when he has found occasion of drinking adulterer joys when he has come to his delighting use of a scrumptious body a forsworn man joys if he has gotten the wellness of this world in swearing the wrathful man joys if he has performed his wrath and my dear brother many other things there been the which the mind of thy goodness may comprehend nevertheless it is good for to joy but it is full great evil for to joy of such things and leading to death of sin neither there is none of all so huge and abominable trespass before God as to each of us for to joy in heart and glad in outward signs in thinking of sins that been passed and to live long in them these things it been which we see above where of the world would that we joy that we perish with the lovers of this world forsooth we owe to forsake these joys as venoms of the devil for they hasten for to slay not only the body but also the soul everlasting I beseech my brother I beseech that thou hurtle these arrows of the devil at the stone that is Christ and take the shield of faith in which thou may quench all the fiery darts of the devil and joy we of the goods of the Lord and of clean conscience and of very confession and worthy penance of mourning and very sorrows the which up God and not up the world works everlasting health forsooth the same heaviness that is up the world the apostle forbids steadfastly and says nile ye make sorrowful the Holy Spirit of God in whom ye been marked in the day of redeeming but all bitterness and wrath and indignation and crying and blaspheme be done away from you with malice and be ye beginning together merciful forgiving together as God in Christ forgave to you and as much as we may with busy study amend we our ways and haste we to get virtues of all goods that we may win the pity of God and mercy in suitable time and joy we greatly that may not be told of the command of the same kingdom to coming these been the armors that arm us against assailing of the devil and prison and take us in keeping to God these been the armors that comfort our minds and keep us noble be these armors within us and without us of God's gift these been our very riches for why chastity makes us chaste and right wiseness makes us rightful pity makes us pitous and meekness meek mildness makes us mild and innocence makes innocents simpleness makes us simple and cleanness makes clean and prudence makes prudent and temperance makes us temperant and charity makes dear worthy to God and to men

Chapter 25- All these good things been of God and they been formed of good God and therefore if we would be in him that we owe for to be as Saint John says as he went so go we ghostly what is it for to go as Christ went but for to despise vanity and welsumness of this world and not for to dread to suffer adversities for his name hope we those things that he has commanded and serve we where he went before the sweetness of this wretched world depart us not in any manner for the love of Christ neither excusing of wife neither love of children neither delighting of gold and silver and of possessions says Saint John apostle witnesses fearfully to us saying on this wise neither ye love the world neither those things that been in the world for all thing that is in the world is covetous of flesh and covetous of eyes and pride of the world these it been that casted out Adam and Eve from paradise of delights into this wretched outlawing for but the love of God had failed from them they should never have begun for to love the counsel of the evil teasing serpent neither they had believed to him and covetous of flesh was fulfilled of them for they tasted of the forbidden apple and also the covetous of eyes for they coveted for to open the eyes of themself and covetous of the world was fulfilled of them for they believed themself for to have been made that thing that is God and therefore the apostle willing all us to beware of these three kinds of death said all thing that is in the world is covetous of flesh and covetous of eyes and pride of the world and my brother that thy goodness may the lightlier understand how our first elders sinned so grievous a sin that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ grant thee for to beware thereof ever for in them twain all mankind was groundly or first damned soothly they had not eat of the forbidden tree if they had not coveted neither they had coveted but if they hadnâ€™t been tempted neither they hadnâ€™t been tempted but if they had be forsaken of God neither they had be forsaken of God but if they hadnâ€™t forsaken God first neither they hadnâ€™t forsaken God but if they hadnâ€™t be proud and so damnably hadnâ€™t despised the likeness of God to which likeness they were made for which thing the sick bodies of them drew death to them and after the sentence of God they been crowned dead in that day in which the need of painful dying is made in them a little before we said these things of the first elders that we may escape the sliding away and example of their damning for though we been born fleshly of Adam nevertheless we should not serve him but we should serve our Lord Jesus Christ by the which Lord we been born again by baptism and in him we live what is it for to serve Adam but for to be slain with everlasting death though covetous and desires of the flesh and what is it to serve blessedly Christ but for to slay in us fleshly covetous and desires and to reign blissfully with him the which has bought us again with the price of his blood and though we for that time that we were in Adam fell down in him now for that we have begin to be in Christ rise we again ghostly with him and but more over that I say all Adam took away from us paradise and Jesus Christ gave the kingdom of heavens and he gave his own body for us sinners for Christ was dead for our sin and not for his own foorsooth each of us shall not die for sins of all men but for his own what is it for to die to sin but for to damn all wicked works in us and for to slay this wretched world as a man dead bodily in sepulcher backbites no man neither is violent to any man he falsely challenges no man neither he oppresses any man neither he has not envy to good men neither contempt does disgrace to evil men he serves not to lechery of his flesh he burns not thirst in him in drinking more and more he burns not in flame of hades he flatters not the rich men of this world he is not ravished with unrestful curiosity he does not his cause by great company standing near to him he begone about with gold and silver or precious mantel is not proud thereof he delights not in salutations of mighty men neither of father and mother he is not feebled in his soul by wrongs or contempts pride makes not him great and covetous of this world slays him not vainglory makes not him to boast foolish gold or silver and all the false riches of this world enflame not him to coveting of them the made wildness of madness drives not him neither fatness or love of horses moves against him and the fairest shape of women yields not him covetous of lusts the words of wretched gossiper or pouters moves not him into lying the strives of this world disturb not him hardiness enhances not him the joys of this world delights him not boldness makes not him wrathful weiwardness makes him not suspicious vanity makes not him a gossiper evil wildness makes not him a scorner turning love of this world makes not him movable and unsteadfast I have drawn along in number these things that thy fullsweet brotherhood understood that a man dead in flesh neither may do these things which I have said neither suffer them and that we be not slow by any such things but study we as much as we may with God's help for to make dead our bodies with vices and covetings and that we be clothed that is to say be we made ghostly a new man the which is formed after God in right wiseness and holiness of truth neither delight we in mens praisings neither gladly give we our ear to backbiters neither believe we to our flatteries neither be we out of accord but rather stir we to accord them whom that we may for by the word of the gospel blissful been the feet that runs to peace neither be we living fleshly in this world for the apostle says if ye should live after the flesh ye should die ghostly he lives after the flesh that lives after himself that is to say he goes wherever he will he sleeps when he will and how long he will he speaks whatever thing he will and eats whatever and when he will and where he will and also he that lives after the flesh drinks when he will and how much he will he lies and is merry unhonestly among whom he will and when he will at the last he that lives after the flesh seeks whatever is sweet to the nose and whatever is blind deceiving in touching and whatever is delightable to the eyes and so whatever is joined to his body he haunts and serves how he will and when he will for he wills fleshly all things both lawful and unlawful he delights him in most fair clothes and horses and armors as he will and when he will and so he lives not after God but fleshly he delights him and fulfills the desires of his flesh as he will and when he will wherefore most dear brother in Christ we owe for to pray heartily God's mercy that ghostly delighting make less the fleshly desires and that pity in us withstand the cruelty of wrath and patience refrain evil willingness and chastity overcome lechery and peace do away fool boldness and measurable stillness stops harlotry and gossiping that ghostly study in wakings and prayers and alms deeds put out curiosity soberness dante drunkenness that mildness be Lord to wrath and madness virtuous sadness govern lightness very chastity shuts out lechery the charity of God and of neighbor refrain the covetous of this world deep meekness defile boast and pride for meekness makes men like to holy angels and pride makes devils of angels 

Chapter 26- and that I show openly pride is beginning the end and the cause of all sins for why pride is not only sin itself but also no sin might be or may be or shall now be without pride foorsooth every sin is none other thing but despite of God by which we despise his commandment and none other thing but pride consoles this to man foorsooth pride and covetous in so much been one evil that neither pride may be found without covetous neither covetous without pride for why of pride heresies been brought forth and dissensions backbitings envies wraths chidings discords strivings fool hardiness covetings of worship high bearings presumptions boost gossiping vanity unrest lying forswearing and such other the which it is long for to number each by himself and covetous makes men gluttons untemperant drunkard desiring much revanesse lecherous spouse breakers defilers of maidens and of kins women full of great trespasses and other unbreakable sins by which the devil is wonâ€™t for to cast down mankind by pride and covetous he says I shall stay into heaven Christ with meekness says my soul is meeked in earth the devil says by pride and covetous I shall be like to the highest God Christ when he was in even hood to God by meekness lowed himself taking the form of servant he I made obedient to the death meeked himself to the father the devil says by pride and covetous I shall raise up my seat above the stars of God Christ says by meekness learn ye of me for I am mild and meek of heart the devil covetous and proud speaks by pharaoh and says thus I know not the Lord and I shall not deliver Israel Christ says by meekness if I shall say that I knew not the father I shall be a liar like to you but I have known him and I keep his commandments the devil proud and covetous says floods been mine and I made them Christ with meekness says I may not of myself make anything but the father dwelling in me he does the works the devil proud and covetous says all realms of the world been mine and the glory of them and I give them to whom I would Christ when he was rich was made poor for us that by his poverty we should be golden rich the devil proud and covetous says as iron that been forsaken been gathered so I gathered all earth and none was that moved a feather and opened a mouth Christ says by meekness I am made like to the solitaire pelican I waked and am made as a solitary sparrow in the roof the devil by pride and covetous says I have made dry by thee step of my feet all rivers of waters Christ by meekness says where I may not pray my father and he shall give to me more than twelve legions of angels and at the last I shall close together the devil with great falling by pride and covetous is cast down to hell and Christ with meekness is raised to heavens therefore dear brother I have described to thee and a few snares of the devils guile and steps of holy meekness that thou now lighter teach thy subjects how they should escape these guiles and by meekness wield the kingdom of heavens and if we would perform the course of our life and fully come to everlasting bliss show we first evil covetous and the devils pride and with all meekness enforce we us for to follow the steps of Christ and if any man serving to an earthly emperor strives for to obey to each commandment of him how much more a man serving to the heavenly emperor owes to keep all heavenly commandments my brother stir thy soul for to wake that no step of sin make it heavy an earthly knight is ready and willful wherever he is sent neither he shall now be excused by love of his wife or of his children much more a knight of Christ owes to obey without letting of this world to his emperor the Lord Jesus Christ which again bought him with his precious blood thou earthy knight goes against thine enemy that maybe say to battle but the enemy unable to be say ceases not to fight against Christâ€™s knight each day thou using bodily armors strives to fight against the body of thine enemy but his wrestling is against the devil with spiritual armors thou bears in battle and iron helm in the head but Christ is the helm of him thou clothes thee with an breastplate lest thou be wounded but he is clothed for the breastplate with charity of christ thou send out spears and arrows against thine enemy he studies for to dress meekness and wholesome words against his enemy thou cast not away thine armors til thou have performed the battle lest thou be wounded of thine adversary he shall never be unarmed for his enemy is more fell wise than thine forsooth thine enemy fights for a time but the enemy of him as long as he is in body ceases not to fight with him thine armors been laborious and heavy to bear but his armors been soft and light thou receives for earthy labor worldly gift but he shall receive for spiritual labor heavenly meed thou makes fair thine arms with honoring of fine linen he takes of Christ with ornament of virtues fairness of his soul for he abides every heavenly gift of Christ which casts away earthy pomp of this world woe to us if we cast away thee soft yolk of Christ and under put us to bear whatever so grievous is and charged us to our soul and while we love the peril we fall into death 

Chapter 27- therefore brother behold we who it is that redeemed us with his precious blood and what we owe to him that redeemed us with so great mischief says we with so great will love earthly father and mother that a little time suffer labors for us where we owe not more to love our heavenly father that for us was fixed on the cross for why whatever service of our fathers and mothers was about us it is the ordinance of him the which made ready to us by his provision fathers and mothers before that we were in this world by the service of whom we were nourished and he filled with milk therefore love we more our redeemer than all other things which with his own hands formed both us and fathers and mothers and charge we to his name and not to our strengths all goods that been done each day against us for holy writing commands us to love our fathers and mothers as our own entrails out take when they forbid us for to neigh to the service of Christ forsooth if they would forbid us that we been not commanded to bury them for Christ is to be loved above our fathers and mothers for father and mother give not to us those things which Christ himself does for he says in the gospel he that loves father or mother or children more than me is not worthy of me by how much any man loves him more by so much he shall be made more at ease and more blissful for he loves us so much that he vouched safe for to die for us and his hands that did most virtues were pricked with nails for our redeeming and unpitous men dressed gall for meat to his honey sweet mouth of which mouth flowed out full helpful doctrine and he that hurt no man was sore beaten and he that cursed no man suffered for us disgrace and warrings he suffered all these things for to give to us everlasting life and though he give to us so many benefits but he asks nothing of us but that we love him and keep to him our souls and our bodies undefiled that he dwell ever in us and we perfectly dwell in him soothly he asks not gold of us neither silver neither mantels neither precious clothes neither fine linen for arms neither fields neither such other things but he seeks ourself he covets to rest in us therefore go we to him that we have everlasting life have we in us the love of God and of our neighbor for he that loves his neighbor has fullfilled the law but againward he that hates him is a man slayer the heart of him that loves his brother is in calmness for the man hating his neighbor is gone about with tempest a mild man is benign yea though he suffer evils he rets it for naught but a wicked man hearing a shrewd word of his neighbor deems despising he that is full of charity goes forth with calm mind and full clear cheer a man full of hatred goes wrathful but thou dear worthy brother move not slander to any man in thy life and do not that is profitable only to thee but that that is pleasing to him and whatever thing not be done to thyself covet thou not that it come to thy neighbor if thou sees him living in good deeds thank thou God together with him and say thou his joy thine and if he suffer any adversity charge thou his heaviness as thine own and love thou never thy neighbor with feined heart for in these things God is stirred to wrath soothly he that calls peace makes dwelling ready to Christ in the house of his soul for Christ is peace and he would rest in peace but in all manners God loathes a man that is wrathful envious backbiter liar and proud soothly an envious man is same to a ship that is thrown with waves of the sea and is ever in disturbing as a ravaging wolf he waxes mad he is held idly in wretchedness and he failing at the last is driven to naught and ever full of madness he is made fellow of fiends a calm man wields a sicker soul he is a place warded of company of angels and he is fulfilled with fruit of myrrh joying and delighting in the Lord all his things live in peace he drives away discord he lightens the privy things of his soul he shall deserve fellowship of angels and he shall get without end the kingdom of everlasting bliss

Chapter 28- my brother I beseech deem thou not the commands of God full of fables or as they were made of me while they been sprung out of the well that is our savior neither any adversity break thy soul either prosperity of the world from the biddings of God and from charity that is in Christ Jesus our Lord for why virtue of thy soul is for to love God and for to hate those things which God loves not soothly virtue of thy soul is for to serve patience and for to bow away from all impatience virtue of thy soul is for to keep chastity both of body and of soul virtue of thy soul is for to despise vain glory of this world and defile all falling things and for to labor while thou live in body for the love of him that redeemed thee virtue of thy soul is for to study to meekness and loathe pride virtue of thy soul is for to forbid and bare down wrath and madness virtue of thy soul is for to bow away from all folly and call the wisdom of God virtue of thy soul is for to subject all delighting of flesh and for to raise thy mind to Christ therefore thou may lightly and full lightly get these virtues if thou will show cure of worldly things earthly and falling and have put no thing before the love of Christ oh my brother love thou God of all thy mind that in all thy deeds thou please him soothly he that is coupled in marriage hastes for to please his wife much more a soul redeemed with Christâ€™s blood owes to please her spouse Christ for God himself would not that he be loved only in words but with clean heart and just works for he is not hearer and beholder of words but of the heart my brother I beesech that fleshly love put never away heavenly love from thee I beesech the flowing and careful sweetness of this world take thee never neither fairness of body deceive thee lest death enter into thy soul by windows of thine eyes my brother say thou to me I beseech what profit is in fairness of flesh whether it dries not as hey that is smitten with heat of summer and little and light lose the first fairness and when death shall come I beseech say thou to me how great fairness shall dwell then in the body then shalt thou acknowledge that that is vain that thou loved before vainly when thou shall see all the body for to swell and to be turned into stink where thou shall not close thy nose thirls lest thou suffer most foul stink I beseech thee where shall be then the sweetness of lechery and plenteous meats of feasts where been the words of flatterers that made nice the hearts of the hearers where been the sweet words that led in bitterness to the lovers where is the unmeasurable lying and foul play where been then the unrefrained and unprofitable gladness this is the end of fairness and of fleshly delighting for why the world shall pass and his covetous oh how much full blissful good is it and how much most blissful for to love the shining fairness of Christ and him for to shine to our breasts with beams of his shining and for to put away all darkness from us give thou not the ears to perceive the words of backbiters lest thou conceive death in thy soul for to the backbiter and hearer backbiting is meat of death to every either and that I conclude shortly a backbiter and willfull hearer bear the devil in tongue I beseech show from thine the snares of backbitings by whom thou hear full many taken ask to the a prudent heart of the Lord and a full waking belief that thou now wisely deem the words of backbiters that thou unknow not the deceits and ambushes of them and into the nets of them come not thy foot all evil vices should be alien from us while Christ would be our heritage therefore for we been uncertain of such cast we down ourself meekly in the sight of our father and bring we forth our sins there between us that he that is our heavenly father do them away and when we have acknowledged thus justify we not ourself praying lest as the same pharisee we go away damned have we mind of the same publican and so pray we that we discern for to have forgiveness of trespasses the cry of our heart knock at the ears of almighty God for in a clean soul he shall be pleased in time of prayer cast we away all malice of heart from us and forgive to men sinning against us soothly there is a kind of serpent the which serpent when it shall begin for to go to drink water before it comes to the well it casts out all venom follow thou this serpent in this party of the gospel word of our Lord Jesus Christ where he says be ye prudent as serpents and cast thou out all bitter venom of wrath and forgive thou to thine even servants that thy sins be forgiven to thee as the gospel commands forgive ye and it shall be forgiven to you give ye and it shall be given to you what manner thou covetist that God be against thee be thou thyself such with thy servant and to each work whatever thou shalt begin todo first incall God and do thankings to him and when thou have fully ended that work do thou on the same manner incall thou God of all thine heart and thou shall find him and when thou have found leave not him that thy soul be joined in his love my brother study thou this in thy life and offer thy clean prayer to the Lord Christ lest useless thoughts of this world disturb thy heart neither thy mind be ravaged into diverse things forsooth think thee to stand in the sight of God that beholds the hid things of heart and knows the privy things of thy mind therefore wakingly and busily stand thou nigh in the sight of God in time of prayer that thou now flee lightlier the nigh coming temptation of the fiend for if the evil thoughts and foul of this world trouble thine heart and constrain thee for to do wickedly any unleanful thing by clean prayers and holy wakings they should be put away from thy soul for why prayer is a great warding of thy soul by most clean prayers all things that be profitable to us be given of the Lord and all joyful things been driven away and that I dispute not long of this as the flesh is nourished of fleshly meats so our inner man that is the soul is nourished and fed of God's speeches and of prayers I beseech feed thou thy soul with ghostly meats that is with faith hope and charity and other virtues by which understood thou for to love God and keep his commands that when the last day shall come angels of peace receive thee and deliver thee from power of the fiend and that thou discern for to fully use the company of saints in everlasting rest and to wield everlasting life with all saints for why thou know most certainly that the possession of the kingdom of heaven is given to thee but look that thou be not made strange therefore 

Chapter 29- I beseech my brother I beseech tell thou to all that been under thee and of goodwill in thine house from the most to the least show thou the love and the sweetness of heavenly kingdom and the bitterness and dread of hell and be thou busy and waking of the health of them for thou shall yield reckoning to the Lord for all that been under thee in thine house show thou bid command console thou them that they keep themself from pride from backbiting from drunkenness from lechery from wrath from misswearing from covetous the which is root of all evils for a covetous man has his soul set to sale if he shall find time that he covet any manâ€™s gold or silver or fair clothes or also if he covet any manâ€™s wife fair in face for naught he does man slaying and as a man charges not to hold water into the earth so it is to him for to shed out the blood of his neighbor forsooth full many souls have fallen into peril of death for covetous and many men for that sin were stoned to the death as the Lord commanded forsooth Saul was made alien from God for covetous and at the last he was cast out of the kings highness and was slain of his enemies and of full many more I might say many things but to a wise man few been I know truly our Lord and our savior would have cast away the love of riches from hearts of the pharisees but for they were most covetous they scorned the helpful words of the Lord for why the love of riches suffered not the same rich man for to enter whom the Lord called to the kingdom of heavens but also the heat of covetous burnt the heart of Judas that he betrayed the Lord that is giver of all goods into the hands of contempt men forsooth a covetous man is same to hell for hell shall never say it is enough how many ever it shall devour so though all treasures should flow into an greedy man he shall never be fulfilled thereof therefore my brother command all that been in thine house for to beware of this vice for it is better that a man give little of his poverty to needy men than to give many things of unrightful getting each man after that that he has dress he forth forso much God asks of each man how much that he has given to him alms that is gotten with wickedness is abominable before God and that thing is pleasing to him that was rightfully gotten soothly there been some ravishing other mens things which see them for to do alms and when they rob other men they see them todo mercy to other forsooth if they gave of their own labor it should be thankful and acceptable to God and pray thou them that in all their works they do meekly before God what thing ever is to be done of them for whatever a man does with pride it shall not be thankful to God that thing that is done meekly is pleasing to him in all their works be they meek for meekness is the highness of virtues neither any man shall come to the kingdom of heavens but by meekness forsooth the labors of long time and prayers and alms deeds fastings and wakings if they should have an end with pride been accounted for naught before God but a meek man is acceptable to God and bears God in himself now we have a little declared of the evil of pride but for men under thee I found this place needful that against the fiends arrows they learn for to raise the shield of meekness forsooth a proud man is hateful to God and a meek man is fearful to the fiend a meek man though he be foul in clothing nevertheless he is glorious with virtues before God but a proud man and fair though he be seen clear in beholding against God he is vile through wicked works and ever his pride and his unstableness is known in words and bearings and in cheer and in going he covets himself for to be praised of men and he wills himself for to be preached in goods to whom he is alien he suffers not himself for to be subject to any man forever among his peers he covets to hold the dignity and for to stay into more degree and that that he may not get by deceits he would ravish by flattering and backbiting and as a ship that is without governor when it is thrown with waves right so a proud man light and unstable is born about by all his deeds but a meek man deems himself the last and he beholding with fair cheer appears high before God and when he has done all things well but he says I am an unprofitable servant and he witnesses himself for to have done nothing and God publishes his works and brings them forth into the middle and makes his deeds wonderful and enhances him and makes him clear and in time of his prayers that thing that he asks he may get before God all one meekness gets these things and other like to these against God for it is the sitting and the delightable couch of our Lord Jesus Christ that says on whom shall I rest but on the meek man and restful and dreading my words and after learn ye of me he says for I am mild and meek of heart I beseech show thou also to thine and say to them that God withstands the proud and the wrath of man works not the right wiseness of God God himself shall wisely deem fornicators and adulterers in the day of doom says thou also of misswearing men a man much swearing shall not escape sin neither vengeance shall go away from his house backbiting is fornication of the soul the prophet says the man backbiting privily his neighbor him I pursued also God hates discord Solomon says God hates six things and his soul wastes the seventh and this seventh is he that sows discords among brethren these been meats and drinks of death to your soul the pity of our Lord Jesus Christ deliver us from these and give he himself to us for to eat that said I am quick bread that came down from heaven he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life in himself but each man before that he receive the body and the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ prove himself and after the bidding of Paul the apostle so eat he the same bread and drink of the cup for he that eats and drinks unworthy both the body and blood eats and drinks doom to himself not wisely discerning the body of the Lord forsooth when we should receive him we owe to acknowledge before our sins and do fruitful penance and to examine more curiously all our deeds and if we should feel in us joyful sins anoon haste we us for to wash them away by true acknowledging and very penance lest with Judas the traitor we hiding the devil within us perish hiding and drawing our sin from day into day and if we have thought anything evil or waywardly thereof do we penance and swiftly haste we for to cast it out of our heart neither say we this is not great sin that I thought in my heart 

Chapter 30- alas why we unwise understand not that our thoughts been open in the sight of the Lord and they been known to him before they go forth into deed forsooth David in the sauter says God is seeking the hearts and reins and after he says the Lord knows the thoughts of men and in another place he says to God thou have understood my thoughts from afar and thou has sought my path and my little cord I beseech suffer we not shrewd thoughts in us lest we charge them as least sins for he that is negligent of the lest things by little he falls down charge we not little the biting of a serpent lest his venom be sprayed into our hearts for though venom be life of the serpent nevertheless it is death to man cut we away tender springs of thorns from the field of our heart lest they fix in us deep roots forsooth we know that our heart is the feel of our Lord Jesus Christ tile we it with heavenly disciplines and suffer we not weeds for to be sown in the field of so great an emperor but make we it fair with all flowers of virtues for almighty God delights in these as in holy writing it is read and flower of the field and lily of even valleys in fairness of the world and virginity of meek men ever and ever be our flesh subject to the soul and as an hand maid serve it to her lady lest we give unlawful strengths to our body that it join battle against our spirit but ever be the flesh subject that it obey to the commands of the spirit neither suffer we the handmaid for to be made fat lest she despise her lady but be she bounded to all her commandments and services for as bridles been to be put on horses so our bodies been to be bridled with fastings and prayers for why as carters been led by fallings down if they slacken the bridles right so the soul with the same body slides to the fallings down of hell if we would not put a bridle there to therefor be we good and wise carters to our body that we may go be the right way for over much of meats harm not only our souls but also our bodies and bring in sicknesses the strength of stomach is wounded for to be broken by over much greediness of meats and intemperance of drink and so abundance of blood and color and full many sicknesses been gendered by largenesses of meats forsooth as these been contrary both to body and to soul so temperance of fasting is medicine to ever either and though we may not by all time namely by most holy days of fastings as much as we may with Godâ€™s help flee we delights of the world and plenty of meats lest any time we tormented in flame seek a drop of water and get not any healing which thing God turn away flee we drunkenness lest we run into sin of lechery for the apostle commands to not fill us overmeasure with wine in which is lechery for God gave to us wine to gladness of heart not to drunkenness therefore drink we not how much foul lust asks but how much the feebleness of kind asks therefore lest we set to death that thing that is given to medicine I beseech thee brother show thou to thy subjects in thine house that many men by wine have done manslayings and fornications neither they forsaken death itself other men by wine been taken by fiends neither drunkenness is other thing than a most open fiend a drunken man guesses himself todo some good thing when he is overthrown by casting down through drunkenness of wine he is armed to warrings and despisings of neighbors and his mind is changed and his tongue blabbers forsooth such a man when he guesses himself to drink wine he is drunken of the wine for why full many men by wine have drawn together most feebleness neither they might ever after get there rather health for they tempted not the burning lust of gluttony for as a fish hastes with greedy jaws for to swallow meat and suddenly finds the hook within the jaws so a drunken man wrestles within him wine his enemy that drives him as death to all their most unlawful work and so a reasonable man is taken as an unreasonable beast but command thou my brother to all thine household money and subjects to thee that they show themself sober and after raise they not themself to pride for abstinence but that they do all things measurably rightfully pitously and religiously for Christ shed his blood not only for us clerks but also for all mankind that been before ordained to bliss neither the kingdom of heaven is only benefit to us clerks but also to all lewd men that keep of all the heart Christâ€™s commandments for why it is a great confusion to lewd men that say thus what part in it to me for to hear in reading the books of holy scriptures to learn or often run to the priests or to churches of saints when I am made a clerk they say I shall do those things which it benefits a clerk to do why understands he not that he will take even part of meat and drink and of all the goods of this earth and also the bliss of heavenly kingdom and will not bear with even labor the yolk of Christ what profit it to such men in one party to high in the world and in an other party to be thrown down in one party for to shine with gold and precious clothes and in another party to be occupied with wretchedness of this life in darkness of vices no busyness be to thee in heart for thou are a person of lewd clothing for against God is none out taking of persons for on like manner heavenly palace is open to lewd men keeping God's commandments as it is to clerks and none honored with holy habit the while there is not now jew neither greek neither slave free man to be out taken but Christ is all things in all things whoever is in the body of him he is great therefore set thou thy self into his holy body that thou be a member of that most noble head of all thine heart love thou thine head that is Christ and all the members of that head how may the hand be enemy to the hand or the foot hate the foot if other members joy together to their jointure and owe to wax into a perfect man to increasing of Christâ€™s body each clerk and lewd man that is redeemed with Christâ€™s precious blood the which is dipped in Christâ€™s baptism owes for to live forth meekly and to last in the holy ghost for it is not worth for to answer himself by words to be a Christian man and deny it by deeds the while he is corrupt in mind and spirit of such men Christ very truth himself says in the gospel not each man that says to me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heavens but he that does the will of my father that is in heavens and in another place the prophet in blaming such men says thus this people honors me with their lips but the heart of them is far from me for why if a city shall be well warded in one party and in another party be destroyed it gives entering to enemies and if a ship shall be made sad with bindings together and have one board hold it shall been drenched by waves of water into the depth forsooth it accords evenly to all lewd men to clerks and monks also for to have faith hope and charity and meekness and for to love God of all the heart to make very acknowledging of our sins and to do worthy penance for the most merciful Lord forgives to men fleeing to penance but be we not so much sicker of Godâ€™s mercy that we increase sin to sin neither say we while the waxing age thrives hate we our lusts and in the last time in the old do we penance of our evils for the Lord is pitous and merciful and he will not think more of our wicked works I beseech that we think not this for it soon seen folly to think these things and it is unpitious thing any man for to will to ask such likeness of God the beginning of which thing is to depart us from God therefore think we not such things say we know not in what day we should die for no man knows the day of his last passing all men die not in their old age but in diverse ages men pass heavens and in what manner deeds each man shall be founded in the same he shall be deemed when the soul shall pass out of the body forsooth the prophet in the sauter says Lord no man in hell shall acknowledge to thee 

Chapter 31- therefore haste we us to be converted to penance and the last day be often turned before our eyes and when we should lie down in our bed trust we us not to come to the light of day and thus we should most lightly refrain our body from vices and evil covetings think our heart ever on heavenly commands bare we over all earthly things that we went into dwellings of heaven to mind that when we should be born there we may use ever heavenly goods for why we believe that when our body shall be unbounded from bonds of flesh if we have lived well and rightly before God anoon the company of angels and of all saints should be joined into our coming and into our embracings and they should fully lead us for to worship the very judge if we done those things while that we live in body as I said that been pleasant to God then peace shall be to us all about and sovereign sickness neither we should then dread more the fiery darts of the devil neither any kind enemy of all them that covet now to smite our souls neither iron neither fire neither the foul face of tormentor neither hunger neither thirst neither any sickness of flesh the flesh shall no more be adversary to the spirit neither we should dread any peril but when we should cast away the heaviness of flesh then the holy ghost shall give to us a dwelling place in heavenly things to whom a little before we had made a dwelling within the hostage of our body and now glad and joying we should abide the day of doom to coming in which doom the souls of all men should receive merits of their deeds and againward sinners and unpitous men should perish forever but robbers and greedy men proud men and adulterers wrathful men and covetous warriors and forsworn men in vain they should most bitterly weep and they should not have without end forgiveness of their evils all they that served the lusts of their flesh should be withheld in full great mourning they should be in sorrow of heart and in everlasting wailing the which served to vices and unskillful desires and when all these should be put in the fires of hell for sins and great trespasses we should receive everlasting mead with saints if we please God while we been in this body therefore despise we all things that been vain and falling that Christ doing mercy to us we may deserve so great glory ever bow we away from vices and go we to virtues neither useless words come forth of our mouth for why we been for to yield reason for our idle words in the day of doom neither would we our tongue to curse any man which tongue is made to bless and hear God neither practice we wicked customs in our doing either in our thought for a custom that shall be drawn along and confirmed is not cast out without great labor be we little in malice and perfect men in mind in some things give we us as old men in some things as judge for it longs to a little child to play soothly to a perfect man it longs for to wail for wailing now gets everlasting gladness after forsooth all thing that is out of good measure makes dissolution of soul and negligent against the commandments of the Lord neither he may lightly again call to mind his trespasses and so he forgets those things that should stir him to penance and so little and little he falls from all goods corruption of heart shall not have any entry there where unmeasureable vices and evil covetings should be had but where tears should be there ghostly fire is kindled that lightens the privates of soul no love of the world depart us from the love of Christ but all our thoughts goto the meeds of the country that is coming and think they of heavenly things this is thy glory this is thy perfection of running of thy strife he is said perfect not which is perfect in age but which is perfect in mind neither childs age annoys any man if that he be perfect in soul neither old age shall profit if that he be little in mind for why David when he was a child had a sad soul and therefore he was raised into a king and Saul when he was in old age for he had in him waywardness was cast out of the kings highness forsooth our Lord and savior was crucified of elder men and he gone into Jerusalem was hurried together of little children for a tree if it be unfruitful of many years is cut down soothly if it shall be new and frutous it is tilled that it bring forth more plenteous fruit therefore I set these likenesses that neither young neither old man in thine house have trust of his health either of his works but he that joys joy he in the Lord but haute thou the company of perfect men and turn thou not away thine ear from the words of them and delight thy soul in their counsel for the words of men dreading the Lord been words of life and health of soul to them that gladly hear and take tent to them as the sun rising drives away mist so the teaching of holy men casts out darkness of our minds I beseech show thou proud men envious backbiters liars foresworn men and despising their own health of soul which been dead to virtues and glad in their fleshly lusts that they want Godâ€™s joys I say not only that thou have not in thine house one such but also wherever thou shall hear such men to be shown them no homeliness be to thee with such manner men neither would thou speak with them if thou may not with the mercy of God again call them from their err for why often by one scabbed sheep all the flock is defiled and a little part of gall turns great sweetness into bitterness for though such a man be seen to thee clear outward and noble in habit and bring forth to thee sweet words nevertheless if he does with thee contrary in works his feigning annoys more that the shape pleases of words forsooth a man is proved not of words but of virtues right so be thou proved against God and suffer gladly all things for the love of Christ and be not thy mind broken with fleshly things when they come neither worldly things that been falling down make weak the strength of thy patience but rather dread thou God though thou shall tarry from thy purpose and whenever thou shall feel thee guilty of sin be thou not confounded to turn to penance for he that shall do penance here he shall not do penance in the last time in all thy deeds and thoughts please thou to God neither study thou to please any other man but to edification of soul and in each work that thou think to do first think on God and examine diligently if that thing that thou think is pleasing to God and if it is rightful before God perform it soothly if it shall be found contrary cut it away from thy soul and do thou all things by counsel and wisdom that thy works and thy paths be dressed after the will of the Lord in each prayer and beseeching pray thou the will of the Lord to be made in thee and not thine own will and after the commandment of the apostle it benefits to pray without ceasing and to raise holy hands to God without wrath and strife

Chapter 32- the Lord is merciful and gives mercy to men hoping in him mercy was not needful to him that had not any sin which made angels and set before archangels but that we get mercy of him he gave alms but alms was not needful to him whos been all kingdoms of heavens which ordained dominions principalities virtues powers but that he should make us partners of the kingdom of heavens by our alms deeds the Lord is patient and peaceable that by his patience and his peace he would reconcile all the world to God that was put in wickedness and also be we patient and peaceable without wrath and strife if we would fully come to God and to all men do we good I say not only to some parties not to one or to two or three but to all men soothly Christ suffered not only for saints but also for sinful men and unpitous and great trespassers he stayed on the cross and by his passion he again called us all to life not only to saints God gave sun and moon and rain and all growing things of earth that spring in earths but in common he gave them to all men which makes his sun to spring on good men and evil and rains on just men and unjust therefore he gave it in common to all men that our good and alms deeds and our charity and our patience and our meekness be dealed in common to all men but most to the household money of the faith and pray we for our enemies and yield we good for evil honor we poor men and receive we Christ in them that said himself how long ye have done to one of these my least brethren in my name ye did to me and thus we should be sons of God and also aires of God forsooth even aires with Christ and we should be partners of his kingdom where we should never die and we should not wax old where mans corruption is not neither any sorrow neither any heaviness of heart after joy neither light of sun neither shinning of moon and of stars but our Lord Jesus Christ shall be light and health life and charity peace and joy and he shall be all good thing to all men believing in him there is the land of men living the which land the prophet praised in his song saying thus I believe to see the goods of the Lord in the land of men living he signifies himself for to see the same heavenly meed and for to reign with Christ without end where neither any night neither day shall be ended neither misery shall be seen neither covetous shall appear but everlasting joy and everlasting gladness these been the promise things of just men and these been the promises of them for the which holy men labored and hasted and ceased not to reign in good works as long as they were in this world in fastings in alms deeds in chastity in continence in long abiding in patience in sweetness in well willing in much labors in prayers in persecutions in hunger and thirst in cold and nakedness in many wakings for Christs love and by all things they show unprofitable wakings forsooth unprofitable wakings been when any man shall wake about many thoughts and foul or to do any contrary thing or unlawful holy men showed such wakings such men despise the world that now is that they may win the kingdom to coming they take not here by commands or wretched riches of the world which lead men misusing them down to hells but they forsaking this present country set before the beholding of their mind to heavenly city whoâ€™s crafty man and maker is God they show sin in word in deed in thought in sight in laughing in starring in thinking with eyes in hands in feet in wrath in chiding in madness in dissension in vein glory in pride in highbearing in covetous keeping away themselves from sin for they fast together two fastings that is fasting of body and of soul for they abstain themselves from wrath and madness and from backbiting and blaspheme and from chiding and such other for as we show before these been meats bearing death of soul the which feed it to evil and slain by everlasting death and these been meats of body and of soul together gluttony much sleep fornication drunkenness fullness and sweetness in lusts and murdering these been meats of body and soul together which feed the body and grieve and slain the soul therefore show we these meats but desire we heavenly meats that draw us to heaven and lead us to God's wisdom to strong faith in Christ kindness well willing patience meekness Godâ€™s virtue and gladness good words and profitable come forth of our mouth savored with Godâ€™s salt that is wisdom to edification of men hearing ever think we in mind the love of God and of neighbor in which hangs all the law and prophets and perform we them in work these been the commandments of Christ whom he commands us for to do and if we would do them we should be partners of his kingdom and we should reign with him in bliss soothly if we should not do them neither he would then give to us his kingdom if we deny him also he would deny us if we believe not he will dwell faithful himself for each unbelieving man does unfaithfully while it is vice of man both to believe all things and to believe no thing with sovereign study and waking we owe to have cure that we hear not of Christ deemer of all in the day of doom that thing that sinners should hear go ye into everlasting fire forsooth hell is verily made ready to the devil and not to all men if they do not the devils works woe to them to whom the gnawing of worms is made ready and burning of flame thirst without quenching weeping and biting together with teeth tears of eyes utter darkness without light pain without end where is no honor or knowing of neighbor but ever during sorrow and wailing where death is desired and it shall not be given where no honor is of elder men neither of king neither Lord above servant neither mother loves son or daughter neither son honors father where all evil and indignation stink and bitterness is plenteous just men dread this and fled these things I pray I beseech and after most dear brother I greatly pray that both we love and dread God and flee these things for everlasting death is to our soul if we last in these

Chapter 33- forsooth three things in this world been worse than all evil the soul of a sinner dwelling still in sin that is blacker than a crow and evil angels that ravish it and hell where it is led forsooth worse things than been these three been there not the same soul also dreading the fear of the doom that is to come and beholding his rot says thus my old wounds have wax rotten and been corrupt of the face of my unwisdom after there been three in this world and none better than they an holy soul lasting in good works that is brighter then the sun and holy angels that take it up and paradise in to whom it is led and abiding the bliss of heaven there been not better than these things in this world forsooth holy angels delight the soul with ghostly song as David says in the sauter Lord blissful is he whom thou have chosen and have taken to he shall dwell in thy tabernacles we should be filled with goods of thine house thy temple is holy wonderful in evenness dear brother think we these things hold we steadfastly these in our mind and be we aware of each sin and wickedness in word in deed in thought in hands in feet in sight in hearing and keeping our body and our soul for Christ our Lord that is God and son of God came down from heaven into earth that he should bear us with him from earth to heaven for us sinners he stayed on the cross that he would deliver us from torment of the devil he received pain of enemies that he would deliver us from everlasting pain he received death that he would deliver us from death he rose again from dead men that we rise again in soul and body in the great day of doom therefore while we have time work we and ever study we for to do good works and pleasing to God together with Godâ€™s help lest suddenly we before occupied with the day of death seek space of penance and may not find it the while we been in this time it benefits us for to sow for in his time that is after death or doom we should reap that thing that we should have in everlasting life forsooth labor we here and bear we together our burdens for where the head went before there should other members serve hold we as it is said before rightful faith certain hope and perfect charity for the faith is as our belief and charity as our health faith believes charity works and hope strengthens and though diverse members have diverse offices nevertheless if all members been holden in unity of charity then they should deserve for to go after the head soothly our head is in heaven and the same truth our Lord Jesus Christ says thus himself of his faithful members if any man serves to me serve he me and where I am there also my servant shall be we aware and by all things be we aware lest by envy hate and backbiting wrath or chiding we be cut away from our head Jesus Christ and whatever thing we or our neighbors should suffer for Christâ€™s love suffer we it together by desire of charity and whatever good thing any other man has received joy we thereof as we had received it and do we thanks for him that has received lo now as we said before some man suffers tribulation or harm of this world or for his guilts is closed in prison by the commandment of the emperor or he is made sorrowful by death of father and mother or of friends if we also sorrow for him we been then ordained in body of the church if we sorrow not then been we cut away from the body of charity that gathers together and quickens all members of the church if God see us to have joy of an others falling anoon he cuts us away from the body therefore by hap we sorrow not of the falling of our neighbors for we been cut away from the body for if we were there without doubt we had sorrowed dear brother behold we and diligently perceive we that so long a member is sore how long it is held together in the body soothly if it shall be cut away neither it shall now be sore neither ought feel for when the hand or any member shall be cut away from the body though all the body be departed then in many parts the same hand that is now departed from fellowship of other members feels nothing such is each Christian man that sorrows not of an others harm or torment or also of death but that is worse in hap he joys of these and now for he is alien from the body therefore he holds not the love of charity in heart the which man the apostle commands for to joy with men joying and weep with men weeping feeling together the same thing and Solomon most openly teaches that we have not joy of the falling of our brethren soothly my brother if we will keep very charity and perfect study we for to love all men as ourself that for Christ is our head we deserve for to be members of him that when Christ our glory shall appear we now deserve to appear with him in joy by according of charity that is love of God and of neighbor as very and perfect members of him loving all men as ourself without any guile of malice or envy forsooth he says himself in the gospel in this thing all men should know that ye been my disciples if ye should have love together for the love of neighbor works never evil 

Chapter 34- and my dear worthy brother says our Lord and our savior that had no sin vows safe by so great love and desire for to love us sinners that he witnesses himself to suffer that thing that we suffer why love we not him by so perfect love says we been not without sin and may redeem our sins by charity the while he loved us so much that also he gave his own son to death for us and says he gave so much kindness and mercy to us wake we virtuously lest we lose the good that he gave to us and also lest we lose the sacrament of our baptism in which we promise to forsake the devil and all his pomps and sins and if we enter into any sin after our baptism merciful Lord has given to us the second baptism that is well of tears and ordained to us penance for our frailty therefore we owe to acknowledge verily our sins and to do worthy fruits of penance after the commandment of a priest dreading God for a priest owes first to cover heal his own sins as a wise and perfect leech and afterward to wipe away and heal other mens wounds and not publish perfectly seek we these if we may find them and take we counsel of our health with such priests that we lose not heavenly heritage the which God has made ready to us from beginning of the world if we serve him in right wiseness and holiness and cleanness of heart and in charity without feigning and cry with the apostle who shall depart us from charity of Christ whether tribulation and anguish where persecution or hunger or sword or other things that serve it is said after that neither death neither life neither angels neither principalities neither things that been now neither to coming neither any creature shall now depart us from charity of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord soothly it is said of the first church that to them was one heart and one soul in the Lord and one will was to them and one unwill for Christâ€™s charity had coupled them into one but againward fleshly men and lovers of this world been departed against themself and unjoined moving slanders each to other strivings wraths chidings dissensions murderings misswearings thefts robberies and all things that this world loves and delights in each man saying thus in his heart I shall do that thing that I will and may I shall fill my thoughts and likings of body my counsels help me or the counsels of my mighty friends or of father and mother gold and silver is plenteous to me servants and handmaidens been to me fields and many possessions of this world mantels and precious clothes where of I may array me I shall fill my will God will give to me space of life and penance alas why dread we not that that the gospel dreadfully sounds seeing thus thou fool this night should devils ask thy soul of thee who should those things be then the which thou have made ready know we we ourself to be men and be we not so proud against the Lord that we perform our evil wills and put so God behind and lest we enforce us afterward to bow the good will of the Lord to our evil wills and we be negligent to amend our shrewd will at the will of the Lord ever being rightful but wherever it delights us we would avenge our wrongs serving on this manner I would do murdering destruction adultery fornication and afterward I will give my redeeming to the Lord which understand we not while we sin so hardily supposing that God may be paid with gifts that then much more we tear him to wrath than to mercy for God delights not in gold or silver neither he seeks other thing of us than our clean souls to be presented in his sight forsooth God joins not himself to the counsels of sinners but he warns us even of our health and gives wholesome counsel for he himself is counselor of our health as the prophet says and his name shall be called a wonderful counselor and after it is said of him in a psalm blissful is the man that went not in the counsel of unpitous men and after for wickedness is not in him and in hap that that we guess to do in alms for us either of lordships of dead men either of robberies of poor men is not seen to be alms for what alms is it that one be clothed and another be unjustly robbed and that one be fed unjustly and another be tormented unrightly I dare say God seeks not these things of us almighty God hates these things hear him that says by the prophet on this wise he that offers sacrifice that is alms or such other thing of raven or of cattle of poor men is as he that slays the child in sight of his father God says by Isaiah I shall not take these things of your hands for your hands be full of blood and another prophet says the bread of needy men is the life of poor men he that beguiles him thereof is a manslayer forsake we to do unright alms if we would do rightful and ghostly alms deeds do we alms deeds of our rightful labors not of ravines either of multiplied fruits of other mens things either of unsuitable merchandises lest by hap they run into these many sacraments or also that is worse for covetous or drunkenness blood be shed out and the voices of them that been tormented with much labor cry to God against us wherefore the prophet says of a rightwise man the which gave not his money to usury and took not gifts upon innocent men and other things which been said before in the same psalm may make a man hearing believing and singing full blissful as also the same psalm concludes he that does these things shall not be moved without end and for the maker of all things shows in telling to his reasonable creature such things and like to them believe we that the maker of naught loves that thing he made of naught he pursues no man if the man pursue not himself first God goes not away from any man but the man himself go first from him neither he hates the kind of us but he hates the vice that we have drawn together and it profits not to us to be redeemed with Christâ€™s blood and willfully to be subjects to the devil therefore think we and again think we that we been not made Christian men for earthly blissfulness neither for riches of this world neither we worship Christ only for this life as the apostle says if we in this life only hope in the Lord we been more wretched than all men forsooth lest we would love gold Christ taught us to despise gifts offered to us lest we should dread hunger he himself fasted forty days lest we should dread nakedness out taken one coat he forbade his disciples to have another lest we should dread tribulations he suffered all things lest we should dread death also himself suffered it and when he taught us all these things not only by word but also by example he went before therefore burn this sweetly in our hearts the fire of the holy ghost make this to burn in us that we serve his steps lest we desire to dwell still in this world and lest we perish with this world alas how much wretched been we if we would not believe this and if we againcall not our soul from the love of this world while we may not hold these everlastingly and we been sicker to lose them what should we do it is to wail to us if we lose the kingdom of God and suddenly it be said to us as ye lovers of the world go ye against the husband that is the dooms man and come ye to him whom ye would not see for ye have put behind his commands for ye should see the same wounds that he suffered for you in his body what should we say then wailing and sorrowing and what for our merits should we answer to him the while we hear often and despise that that the prophet says what shall I yield to the Lord for all things that he has given to me I shall take the cup of health and I shall incall the name of the Lord

Chapter 35- hold we steadfastly that the hope of good things is not put in this world though it seem to be worldly hope which is turned into bitterness and the world itself bears a bitter drinking to his lovers and truth himself that is God speaks to them saying thus where is that thing that ye loved where is that thing that ye held for great and my brother where our fleshes been of iron that they tremble not together or also our belief is hard as stone of adamant that it wax weak or also wake not at so great words of God why see we not with the prophet who shall give water to our head and to our eyes a well of tears that we weep night and day the wounded souls of our people the eyes of them fail in weeping the which behold not only the deeds of bodies but also of souls of Christian men what mourning is more suitable what wailing may be founded more certain then when each man morns of the soul lost and so he sorrows with the apostle that said who is made sick and I am not made sick also who is slandered and I am not burnt and after in another place having compassion to love of neighbors he says on this wise I desired to be departed from Christ for my brethren learn we in so great apostle of Christ to burn with so great charity of God the while he knows that he spared not to his only son but gave him for us all he says for us all therefore no lewd neither clerks no neither hallowed virgins neither widows owe to despise the health of their own souls the while it is open known that the price of so great blood is shed for us therefore all we that been left on earth know we our sins lest we perish with unpitous men the while we please not soon him by worthy satisfaction how sweetly pleased the prophet his wrath that said I knew my sin and I hid not my unright wiseness I said I shall tell forth against me my unright wiseness to the Lord and lo what served after and thou have forgiven the unpity of my heart God is ever ready to forgive our sins if we would not tarry to turn again to him for if we should tarry dread we lest he bring in on us his wrath for soothly he before ordained some to torment and soothly to some he gave great benefit but nevertheless not unrightfully he ordained this but in his high doom for why Cain did fully manslaying and Job wounded is made Godâ€™s friend and Abel innocent was slain of his brother nevertheless neither Job suffered longer torment neither he gave place to any to forgive neither he forsook Paul buffeted whom he made strong by his grace neither he received Judas doing penance neither he forsook Peter weeping and so the pitous and merciful Lord by his high doom departs vessels of mercy and if we perceive wretched Judas some time a perfect vessel brought fully into damnation he might not bear virtue of the Holy Ghost whom anoon as he had taken he bares and so he all broken was profitable to nothing dreading this be we converted to God while time is for the prophet says seek ye the Lord while time is and be ye made sad seek ye his face always for time is and be ye made clean and if we be broken into any sin we have almighty former and crafty man believe we for he is mighty to restore things that been lost the which made of naught all these things whole for he says himself ye been in my hand as the clay of a potter in his hand therefore meek we us under the hand of almighty God that he enhance us in time of visiting at the doom think we us to stand always in the sight of God and know we what we been know we that we been ash and earth while the prophet says against us on this manner what are thou proud earth and ash that if we know not ourself verily we would enhance our heads says God withstands proud men and gives grace to meek men be ye meek men comforted says the Lord your God be ye comforted that been of little spirit be ye comforted and nile ye dread now lo your God shall yield doom he shall come and make you safe the Lord is nigh be ye nothing careful that the unblissfullhood of the world fear you not for if all holy men had dread this worldly unblissfullhood they should not have had everlasting blissfullhood if we short passing blissfullhood of this world is loved here the everlasting blissfullhood is not found after soothly if everlasting blissfulhood is sought the which is not found here go we to everlasting blissfullhood where we have country and our father and mother suffer we most patiently all things of this world for Christâ€™s name I pray what is it that is suffered of us against that that is given to us the apostle says the sufferings of this time been not even worthy to the joy that is coming that shall be showed in us therefore none oppressing fear us neither any wretchedness break our trust of the Lord for the Lord is nigh our shepherd is about us what should we dread and if we dread cry we to our shepherd that he here us cry we in sorrowing of heart saying thus I have erred as a sheep that has perished Lord again seek thy servant cry we and say Lord deliver my soul from sword and my heart from the power of the hound save me from the lions mouth cry we and say fleeing away has perished from me and none is that againseeks my soul I shall behold to the left half lo a wolf as the devil he roars as a lion he gnasts lo a wolf as an hound barks against me Lord I cried to thee I said thou are my hope my portion is in the land of men living deliver thou me from the hands of my enemies and of them that pursue me where our good shepherd that has put his life for his sheep if we cry to him shall suffer us to err longer or to be drawn of wild and unreasonable beasts and to be wasted God forbid it but rather the ninety and nine sheep I left he went to seek one sheep that was lost neither for he heard the sheep crying therefore he went but before it cried he went for the gospel says ninety and nine sheep left he went to seek one sheep that had perished the which sheep when he had founded and was made weary and faint he put it up on his shoulders and brought it again to the folk the shepherd vouched safe to bring it again on his shoulders and by his mercy to againcall it from err soothly for as much that the Lord has brought again to the flock this sheep thus put on his own shoulders how many thankings been to be done to his mercy that so much meeked himself and bowed down to us he bears us and repairs us he governs and keeps us we pray greatly the good Lord sovereign and best shepherd that the sheep perish not fill thou the office of the most sovereign shepherd pursue thou the lion that ravished the sheep of thy flock the lion be slain and the sheep be delivered from his cheeks for thou are the shepherd of all sheep and our king mighty to tread Satans under our feet and now Lord our shepherd and our king so many sheep been ravished each day of thy flock and why are thou so much still answer why are thou still lo thy sheep been ravished by diverse castings a down and thine enemies that hate thee raise their head against thee and thou are still one Lord God why are thou so long still 

Chapter 36- to these things the Lord cries by the prophet and says I was still but I shall not ever be still my hand does doom therefore thou Lord Jesus our shepherd and our king take thy armors and go forth that thou fight against the lion our adversary which compasses seeking to devour us Lord be thou to us a tower of strength from the face of the enemy we ask that thou deliver us for the world is set in wickedness lo evils wax great and lovers of the world perish they blaspheme they wax mad and they greave against thee and not only they pray not thy mercy but also they reap thy doom who works such things in them but the author of evil the proud angel lost and coveting to lose all men Lord God deliver us from all evil and be our part with each good we been delivered from each evil when we been departed from the devil and his angels forsooth they been his angels that do his will no part be to us with such that do the devils will but with him that said if any man shall do the will of my father he is my brother sister and mother soothly we been redeemed with price of him flee we the fellowship of evil men seek we good things cleave we to most sovereign good serve we to him do we his will that also we be the angels of God of the which angels the prophet says bless ye to the Lord all his angels his ministers that does his will for the will of our father is as the gospel says that not one of his little perish and that we perish not and be drawn out of the right way do we away the works of darkness and be we clothed with armors of light and the midst of night I cast out and the roots of darkness I drive away the beam of very light shine in our hearts in the night do we not the works of night that is works of sin but do we works of day that is virtues for we been called God's sons neither our belief wax slow by liking of sleep neither by vain fantasies enclose our souls neither rest bow down the same bodies that bears a down in deep sloth by heat of the beds but in waking praying fasting and saying psalms fight we against the devil our adversary and feel we great light held into our hearts and in the night do we perfectly the works of God for what thing owe we to do in the dark night of this world but to drive away the devil and bring in Christ what owe we to do in blindness of this night but to make captive the captive maker and to serve the deliverer what owe we to do in the night but to smite out of our hearts the devils darkness that is sin and to draw out by the root pride and bring in meekness what owe we to do in night but to cast out from us the prince of all vices and to receive the well of all goods most dear brother receive we him that we may be received of him and see we what goods we have made ready of him that calls us each day and receive we his light yolk and his soft burden that relieve the burden of our sins put we away the works of darkness and be we clothed with armors of light forsooth what is it to put away works of darkness but to forsake pomps of the devil that is pride and his angels and what is it us to be clothed with armors of light but to believe into God the father almighty the which lightens each man coming into this world and that said also while ye have light believe ye into light that ye be the sons of light first nevertheless most loved brother if thou will discuss well and wisely deem we and seek we who is the devil or what thing he is soothly the devil is an angel departed from God by pride which stood not in truth and he is a teacher and father of lying for lying was first found of him as the most soothfast our Lord Jesus Christ speaks in the gospel of John for he is head and end of lying he deceived of himself hastes to deceive us also he is made adversary of mankind finder of death ordainer of pride root of malice head of great trespasses prince of all vices all enticer of foul lusts therefore when he beheld the same first man made of God that is Adam the father of us all as thou may often understand before and he say the same man made of slime of earth to God's image honored with chastity made fair with temperance compassed with charity clothed with undeadliness he enemy and envious that an earthly man had take so much blissfullhood that he while was an angel is known to have lost by pride anoon the greedy murderer not withstanding that yet he had envy to our father and robbed us and our father and mother also of so great goods and over that killed us for why and in the first front the devil robbed us of many goods that is to know chastity continence patience mildness charity and undeadliness and so he left us naked and wretched and joys that we been wrapped in his clothes and be bounded to his lordship and of that bond he bound to himself all our generation he robbed us of chastity and gird us with unchastity he robbed us of temperance and made us untemperant he robbed us of charity and clothed us with malice he robbed us of undeadliness and bridled death to us also he wrapped us and our after comers in these foulest and most stinking clothes and left us half quick and for the most cruel enemy has done so wretchedly about us yea for he has done so lo my most dear worthy brother forsake we this harmful heritage we been made fatherless and motherless before that the wrong asker of so much worst heritage come forsake we all things that been his and so if any would despise to forsake this heritage in which the devil clothes been that is pomp and his angels when the dooms man shall come as the gospel speaks he being debtor shall be take to the wrong asker forsooth the wrong asker shall close the debtor into prison soothly I say to you says the Lord thou shall not go thence till thou yield the last farthing truly God's scripture takes into keeping to God all man kind as poor and fatherless and motherless saying thus the poor man is left to thee thou shall be helper to the fatherless and motherless and the scripture showing his adversary the devil joined to this sentence altobreak the arm of the sinner and of evil willing our Lord Jesus Christ be nigh pitous and merciful that he gives some mercy to this poor and fatherless and motherless for he suffers a fell adversary and most fierce now also the fatherless and motherless fails in his cause wherefore this adversary hates to deceive him by shrewd crafts Lord Jesus Christ be thou a ready defender to this fatherless and motherless stand thou in his cause which commands to the sons of men to deem right wisely raise thine arm and together break the arm of the sinner and of evil willed thou have known best the cause of this poor and fatherless and motherless that is mankind for he is indebted of fathers obligation he is found guilty and he strained on each side is held of the adversary none other thing is how help shall come to us but of thy counsel and thy help is full needful Lord deem our cause and defend for thou are mighty

Chapter 37- And my dear brother how blissful is the soul that has such a defender wherefore now I beseech each of us wake lest in the day of doom the devil know his clothes against him and begin to be held guilty ever whom Christ would to be delivered by his grace neither flattery they evil to themself which would not be amended after grace received and after turned again to the same their former lusts for the day of doom is abiding then shall all the same most even judge come the which shall not out take the person of any mighty man whoâ€™s palace no bishop neither abbot neither earl shall now corrupt by gold and silver all souls should stand near that each tell up that thing that it has done in body either good either evil forsooth and the devil adversary shall be ready and our professions should be rehearsed and he shall cast against us into the face whatever thing we have done and in what day we sinned and in what place and what of good work we ought have do in that time and if we should be found such the same adversary shall joy full out in the sight of the most pitous judge crying himself to be higher than we doing such a cause against a judge for then the same adversary the devil has to say thus most even judge deem thou this man to be mine for sin which would not be thine by grace he is thine by kind he is mine by wretchedness he is thine for passion mine for enticing unobedient to thee obedient to me of thee he received the skill of undeadliness of me he received this foul coat in which he is clothed he lost thy cloth he came here with my cloth lo what thing unchastity did against him what untemperance what covetous did what wrath did what pride did with other members he forsook thee he made fleeing to me I see my sisters to follow with him what therefore did he that disputed with pride that was mad with wrath he treasured wrath to him in the day of wrath he shall say thus then most even nigh deem thou for right wiseness and doom is the making ready of thy seat deem thou him to be mine and to be damned with me all these things that he brought here I know to be mine he would be mine and he coveted my things with me he shall be pained for whom thou vouched safe to deliver by so great price he would afterward willfully bind himself to me alas alas most dear brother where such a man shall now open the mouth that is founded there such that justly he be deemed with the devil see we what we done see we how we should be delivered from him see we and beware lest we had received God's grace in vain but by whole heart and perfect faith renounce we and despise we so harmful heritage of the devil lest we dwell fatherless and motherless and poor the dreadful sentence of Saint Paul and dreadfully brought forth be rehearsed in the middle of us which make our hearts and also our bodies to tremble for he says thus a sacrifice for sins is not now left to us willfully sinning after we have received knowing of the truth soothly there is a dreadful abiding of doom and serving of fire which shall waste adversaries any man making void the law of Moses dies without mercy between two or three witnesses how much more guess ye him to deserve worse torments which shall defile God's son and shall lead the blood of testament defiled in which ye been hallowed and that shall do contempt to the spirit of grace soothly we know who said to me vengeance and I shall yield it and after it is said forsooth the Lord shall deem his people for it is fearful thing to fall into the hands of living God and a little after it is said thus and so nile ye lose your trust that has great rewarding patience is needful to you that ye doing the will of God bring in the promise for yet is a little time and he that is to coming shall come and he shall not tarry for to yield to each man after his works these words have not flowed out of me but out of Saint Paul that said thus where ye seek experience of him that speaks in me that is Christ stretch we out the inward sight and see we and lay we to the ear of heart to behold and search so dreadful a sentence of the apostle make we clean the eye of heart yea same light that we desire to see cleanse our heart that it be cleansed from darkness of sins with his mercy for he says blissful been men of clean heart for they should see God unprofitable labor to deathward be not here to us but labor profitable to health run we while we have light lest darkness catch us and after the apostle teaches us full diligently saying thus rise ye up slow hands and knees unbounded and make ye rightful paths to your feet that no man halting ear but rather be healed serve ye peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see God beholding lest any man fail to Godâ€™s grace lest any root of bitterness spring upward and let it and many men be defiled there by and a little after it is said see ye lest ye forsake the Lord speaking to you for if they that were unbelieving to God's word and escaped not forsaking him that spoke on earth much more we that hear the Lord speaking from heaven to us and but turn away whos voice moved the earth now soothly he promises saying thus yet once and I shall move not only the earth but also heaven soothly that he says yet once he declares overturning of moveable things as of made things that those things perish that been unmovable and so we taking kingdom unmovable have grace by which serve we pleasing to God with dread and reverence for why our God is fire wasting that shall waste adversaries go we nigh to him before that we be wasted of him asking him to burn our heart and our reigns and after it is said for thou God has proved us thou have proved us by fire as silver is proved soothly most opportunity it is plain for if we been not burnt here of him truly we that been his adversaries should be wasted therefore the apostle says forsooth no man beguile himself no man deceive  himself by vain words for what ever things a man sows now the same he shall reap after speak we not other thing in tongue and other thing in heart lest we be Judas and Herodians other men in perdition other men in acknowledging other men in feigning but been we other men in meekness of truth therefore with very heart in plenty of faith haste we that our hearts be springed from evil conscience hold we the confession of our hope unbowable and desire we not only the beginning of good works as it is of custom of some men but also continuing to the end and by so much the more that we seen the day of doom neighing break we the pride of our flesh for it is the flesh that loses the soul and brings to all pride and he that sows in flesh as the apostle says also he shall reap corruption of his flesh it is the flesh that receives the devil forsooth the devil sows in our flesh his seeds that is manslaying fornication covetous foul lust wrath chiding drunkenness pride theft and all evil suggestion for the apostle says wrestling together is not to us against flesh and blood but against spirits of this air against spiritual wickedness in heavenly things he says this of the devil that is an evil spirit and is not seen and he that worst spirit is cast down from heaven with his angels of which spirit it is said in the apocalypse lo the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them night and day and they overcame him for the blood of the lamb of whom the apostle says a prick of my flesh an angel of Satans is given to me the which buffeted me wherefore thrice I prayed to the Lord that it should depart from me and he said to me my grace is enough to thee for virtue is performed in sickness after he rehearsing says I see another law in my members reproving to the law of my soul and making me captive into the law of sin that is in my members after Paul says soothly by my soul I serve to the law of God but my flesh serves to the law of sin and after he says nothing of damnation is to them that been in Christ it is the flesh that receives the devil and the devil has the flesh in his power and not the soul therefore the apostle says a prick of my flesh is given to me he says not of my soul but of my flesh an angel of Satans soothly Job was tempted in his flesh of the devil as the Lord says and power is given to him in the cattle of Job and after God says to the devil I shall give him to thee into power out taken his soul 

Chapter 38- The flesh covets against the spirit soothly the spirit covets against the flesh forsooth these been adversaries against themself that not whatever things ye will ye do them the flesh is a wretched beast that grieves the soul as the apostle says they that been in flesh may not please to God also the same truth our Lord Jesus Christ says of himself soothly the spirit is ready but the flesh is sick truly our flesh would ever be mighty in malice it finds itself to be sick in abstinence that is in fastings and prayers and good works it is our flesh that drenches us into the ditch the apostle says slay ye your members that been on earth that is fornication uncleanness wrath chiding and other things that serve and after he says do ye not cure of the flesh in your covetings and so slay we our flesh by abstinence by fastings wakings and prayers lest it bring to us the devil by evil covets soothly the flesh is given to us as battle of soul which flesh if it be slain leads to life if it be nourished it makes ready itself to battle against the soul soothly I praise him that may have power of his flesh the while we dread the sickness of our flesh we despise the health of our soul a wretched soul what says thou whom the flesh grieves so strongly as Solomon says the flesh that is corrupt grieves the soul and after he rehearsed the mouth that lies slay the soul woe woe to the wretched soul whom the flesh pursues our flesh fights each day against the soul and we owe to fight each day against the flesh as the apostle commands if ye should live after the flesh ye should die soothly if ye should slay the deeds of the flesh by spirit ye should live the flesh desires and shows all evil suggestion the flesh covets all evil the flesh stirs venomous deeds the flesh tears wrath the flesh stirs manslaying the flesh stirs adultery and chiding the flesh brings in drunkenness the flesh bears all covetous of this world and the flesh desires all evils a flesh cruel beast what have thou what grieves thou the soul that no thing had desired but to serve God if she had not joined herself to thee but thou wretched flesh not only slays thyself but also thou slays the soul thy damnation suffers not to thee but yet thou wills thy soul to be drenched into hell thou soul woe to thee that have take the flesh contrary against thee which neither it enters neither it suffers thee to enter into the kingdom of heavens a wicked flesh what seeks thou what desires thou thou will not sustain labor thou unrestful wilt not rest together thou strangles the soul that againward thou be lady and she handmaid I pray why grieves thou the soul that is not grievous to thee neither thou shall escape pain the while she suffers hell neither she shall now be deemed without thee in the day of doom which agrees thou not to our spirit and soul as the gospel teaches thee saying thus be thou consenting to thine adversary anoon while thou are with him in the way that is in the world lest in hap he gives thee to the judge that is Christ and the judge gives the to the ministers that is to evil angels and the ministers send thee into the prison that is into hell thou shall not go thence till thou yield the last farthing that is the least sin what are thou and what gives thou to us but pairing of our soul he that nourished thee nourished thee to do evil for the soul sin not but by flesh as it is written the soul that shall do sin the same shall die in example thou says how may the soul sin says it is not seen what may it dread when it is not holden the same flesh sins that greaves the soul and the soul overcomes of the flesh consents to the flesh in sins for the flesh is rushing to foul lusts unceasable to gluttony often stirring to lechery unshamefast to fornication it puts each day blame upon blame sin upon sins it ceases not to join together worse things to all the worst cruel in will vain and unwise ever ready to evil seeking excusings and slowest to good swift to death hard to life to whom the workers of light been hateful and the workers of darkness most loved for it loves to fall despises to rise health is bitter to it and perdition sweet ever falling worse into evils and from worse things fleeting into all their worst it is unrestful impatient in flame of hell compassing the soul casting in among them borrowings of covetous and greediness of vanity and pride of wrath and impatience and of other wickednesses it casts down itself into useless things and unhonest drawing itself away from heavenly things and delighting in earthly things it forsakes truth it hastes to draw vanity and words of lying and what more things yet as a moth devours wool and as fire wastes trees stir and stubble so the rebel flesh and delicate wastes and burns the soul what says thou soul to these what answers thou to these she says thus I shall say to my redeemer before that I be delivered of flesh what shall I answer to these and to what good I would stir the body with which I dwell Lord I beseech thee the coveiting of lechery be not in me but the love of cleanest chastity dwell in me be I slow to here evil hasting to thy word running to perform it be I busy in thy dread perfect in thy love stable in faith nothing doubting in hope burn I in love of neighbor be I not burnt with heat of hate neither wax I lean in weary of envy ever breathe thou in me that I think holy work constrain me that I do it counsel me that I love thee confirm me that I dread thee keep thou me that I lose not thee the foot of pride enter not any rest in my house where thy dwelling owes to be neither covets of gluttony neither fornication neither greediness neither envy neither wrath neither heaviness neither vain glory but I ask deep meekness of thee that said on whom shall I rest but on the meek and restful and dreading my words give thou to me deep meekness by whom the highness of the proud flesh that strangles me be bowed give thou measured abstinence by whom the useless greediness of the womb that loses me be refrained give thou chastity of heart that may yield me undefiled give thou cleanness of spirit for unclean lechery of flesh drenches me give thou will to give large alms by which the hard holding covetous be forsaken give thou love of charity by which the burning of envy be quenched grant thou patience of suffering by whom the cruel beast wrath overcome may fail give thou hope of everlasting joy by whom the bitterness of heaviness be swaged give thou me to glory in thee within in soul of good work where vain glory be out of me and boast come not forth also give thou to me in all things to hold right wiseness ghostly hardiness and temperance and make me with simpleness to be prudent that also I lead blissful life cleanly and that I flee warly evil and that I may understand the guileful and deceivable bitterness of the devil lest he deceive me by likeness of good and that I may deem reasonably and before see what good I shall do and what evil I shall flee

Chapter 39- after these things make me mild of good will calm debonair mannerly without feigning to be according to all good things in wakings in fastings in prayers steadfastly strong give thou also to get a measurable word in mildness give stillness that I speak that thing that seems and that I hold still that thing that it benefits not to speak or whatever thing thou shalt vouch safe to give of fruits of virtues give thou to keep to thee faith unblemished without any err and of faith my works to be worthy and that I defile not right faith by shrewd works and that I deny not thee in evil living whom I acknowledge in well believing and that I offend not thee by works of negligence whom I serve by strong faith make me living in holy purpose to serve right wiseness to love mercy and truth and forsake lying to think not or speak any false thing to dread thee without ceasing for to love thee to keep thine commands to hold peace with all men without treachery to call discording men to accord without feigning to offer charity to all men unfeigned to slander no man to set me before no man but to deem me lower than all men to give reverence and honor not for dread of mighty men but for him that is most high to offer obedience to elder men and charity to peers to show grace of best love to younger men to suffer evenly brethren charges to profit together to all men and not to harm to annoy no man to be adversary to no man to do false challenge to no man to deem no man to backbite no man to slander no man to be wrongful to no man to take no mans life to ambush no mans path but only to be busy of my life neither to yield evil for evil neither to be mindful of my wrongs neither in any manner to seek vengeance but in all goodness to overcome malice to make ready blessing to the cursing love the enemy as friend to suffer shrewdness and despising of wrathing men not to yield wrongs soon to forgive them to forgive offendings ever to be ready to grant forgiveness not to covet other mens things neither by any occasion to take them away to give mercifully my things to men that have not to hold against me for thee that redeemed me to fill thereof the hungering to give drink to the thirsting to gather to harbor the harborless to heal the naked to visit the sick to seek the prisoned to comfort the sorrowful to have compassion to the tormented and to the mourning to give needful things to him that has not to depart lifehood and clothing with the needy to call the poor born in the land to nourish the homely of the house to love the pilgrim to redeem the captive to receive the stranger to defend the motherless and fatherless to help the widow and relieve the oppressed to give help to the discomforted to break diversely the bindings together of unpity or whatever things the reachings of thy commands declare diligently to believe them and here to seek it with burning desire to cover it prudently to hate it hastily to fulfill it desiringly and ever to be meek before thee that I rise and be not cast down that I be raised and fall not that I go up and not down for the flesh with which I dwell would ever lead me to sin it would be crowned with me but it would not labor with me I suffer no worse enemy than the body in which I dwell for why as a lion he is destroyer in my house on each side wasting and to rending me with deadly biting therefore I drawing along groanings shall say in often crying I am unblissful man who shall deliver me of the body of this death the grace of God by whom by Jesus Christ our Lord and Jesus good savior this I would thou best redeemer this I would that here to not heartily I prayed in beseeching and this I heartily pray for why thy most precious blood I am redeemed that I perish not without end for the corruption of flesh come I not into the second death neither into the land of forgetting this my voice sow in the ears of thy mercy that I do not the will of the flesh and all my mind think on thee and delight in thee serve thee and acknowledge thee for in redeeming me thy mercy is without end and in thy mercy I that was lost lost in sins lived again and I rose again from dead men for thou have departed me from sins of my young waxing age and I do penance before thee for thou have kept to me time of turning to thee for I beholding my sins am regretful and with thine inspiring I did penance before thee now I glad yield always thankings to thee without number for first thou sought me that I should find thee thou constrained me that I should turn again to thee thou beheld me as a meek father that I should be troubled for my sins thou wrote that I should acknowledge and thou have given to me rain of grace that thou would acknowledge me Lord put thou my tears in thy sight and my heart prayer fully come to thee into heaven I pray come thou and help and receive myself taken to thee in thine hands thou shall deliver me from the mouth of the fierce dragon and from the hand of most cruel hell when thou shall receive and shall take away from the middle the shadow of death yea thou shalt lead me forth into the path of light and into the most clear country of men living set me in most sicker folds of thy flocks for thou are a good shepherd that againseeks and againbrings lost things defends and saves things founded nourish and heals sick things and thou are merciful Lord that confounds not men hoping in thee forsake not men again seeking thee but in fullout joying thou receives and grants them to reign without end in everlasting bliss together with thy saints and chosen for to thee with the father and the holy ghost one God head is glory virtue lordship and power into worlds of worlds amen.
